      <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, many of the people I know suffer from chronic illnesses.
        I would ask them if they are interested in giving an interview which
        would give me insight on the best design of the app. I would ask them
        about the current processes they use to manage chronic illnesses. How
        interested they seem in different aspects of their management process
        would give me some insight on what types of questions I should focus on
        when running the survey. For the survey, I would ask questions to make
        clear what features should be focused on and promoted the most within
        the app.

      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>
        My strategy for usability testing would be to ask my users to navigate
        through the current iteration of the app and try to use the feature we
        would like to test.
      </p>
      <p>
        For testing creating a reminder, I would ask the user if they can do it
        without giving instructions and the user would need to be able to
        navigate home -> reminders -> new reminder -> submit button. Similar
        processes would need to be done for creating new appointments or
        updating usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        For testing viewing appointments, I would ask the user to tell me what
        their current appointments are without giving instructions and the user
        would need to be able to navigate home -> appointments and give me the
        requested information. Similar processes would need to be done for
        viewing reminders or usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failing to complete any of my tests would imply the app has bad user
        experience at least in the case of this user and I should try to improve
        it if possible before testing again.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        The research and analysis steps helped me decide if I were to build this
        app, which features need to be prioritized and promoted to the user. The
        creation of user personas wouldn't, in my opinion, provide much use to
        me because it is simple to understand the types of people who would use
        this app. I would use them to explain to potential investors that a
        market exists for this app since they would likely want a visual
        demonstration of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user journey map gives me a good idea of how a specific function of
        the app will be executed while also giving the perspective of the user.
        This helps me decide on how to craft the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating wireframes helped me get the visual I had out of my head and on
        the screen without much work. If I had to collaborate with others then
        this would be an invaluable communication tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a prototype gave me the opportunity to actually implement some
        of the app. This lets me do some actual testing in the usability testing
        step. From here I can refine the app if the current design doesn't work
        or fails usability tests.
